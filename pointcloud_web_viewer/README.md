Pointcloud Web Viewer
=============

Pointcloud Web Viewer is a webpage based on Three.js to visualize point clouds. You can see it in action here:
[SRV Point Cloud Viewer][link_srv]


How to use it
-------

Download the code and upload it to your server (using for example [FileZilla][link_filezilla]). You can modify it as you wish to meet your requirements.

Then, you have to upload pointcloud files in ASCII mode into the 'data' directory. The format of these files must be as follows:

-2.09482,0.305857,0.203584,219,225,199
-2.46393,0.879894,0.204576,238,243,203
-2.42189,0.920989,0.200718,254,254,232
....

One point for each line, separated by commas and with the following meaning:
x, y, z, r, g, b

Where r, g, b, are integers of the primary colors (red, green and blue) from 0 to 255.


Mouse controls
-------

- Rotate: Hold down the left mouse button and move
- Zoom in/out: You have 2 options:
	a) Rotate mouse wheel
	b) Hold down the mouse wheel and move
- Pan: Hold down the right mouse button and move


Compatibility with Point Cloud Library (PCL)
-------

If you are using the [Point Cloud Library (PCL)][link_pcl] for your 3D projects, and want to plot your .pcd files, you have to convert them to the format specified before. I've created a [ROS][link_ros] node that takes a .pcd file (XYZ or XYZRGB) and convert it to .txt file that can be directly used by the Point Cloud Web Viewer ([Source Code][link_pointcloud_to_webgl]).


Problems to visualize it?
-------

Three.js is a javascript library based on WebGL. WebGL is NOT suported by all browsers, you can check the compatibility of your hardware/software with webgl here:

[WebGL Check Compatibility][link_webgl]

If you don't see a spinning cube you can not use this software neither. To solve this problem, you can try the following:

* Install Google Chrome Web Browser
* If you can not see the cube using Google Chrome, type this in your address bar: chrome://flags/ and make sure you have enabled the following features:
	1. Flag 'Override software rendering list' IS ENABLED
	2. Flag 'Disable WebGL' IS DISABLED
* If you have changed some of these flags, restart Google Chrome and try again.
* If this does not solve the problem, make sure that your graphic card supports 3D acceleration.


What is wrong?
-------

Many things, this is just a preliminary version of the code, any contribution is welcome!

The example pointcloud included in the code (data/pool_demo.txt) was taken with Girona500, an AUV from the [University of Girona][link_cirs] (Spain).
